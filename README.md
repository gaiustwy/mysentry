# MySentry

**MySentry** is a Flask-based application designed for motion detection and object recognition using OpenCV and the YOLOv8 model. The application captures and processes video streams, detects motion, identifies objects, and sends email alerts with relevant details and images.

## Features

- **Motion Detection**: Detects motion in real-time using OpenCV's background subtraction method.
- **Object Recognition**: Identifies objects in the detected motion using the YOLOv8 model.
- **Email Alerts**: Sends email notifications with detected object details and attached images.
- **Video Recording**: Records video clips of detected motion and saves image previews and metadata.
- **Exclusion Zones**: Configurable zones where motion detection is ignored.
- **Web Dashboard**: A user-friendly interface for monitoring video feeds, managing clips, configuring settings, and viewing motion detection status.
